# Prompt Notes

Some notes I want to incorporate but haven't tried yet.

## C\#

- As part of the Copilot prompts, include instructions to strictly use `dotnet` commands to validated builds and tests running instead of the internal VS Code task runners, since they don't seem to report accurately.
- Add instructions to not modify original logic, to only update tests and new code
