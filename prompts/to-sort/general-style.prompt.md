```plaintext
When writing code, prioritize the following design principles across languages:

- **Favor data-driven design:** Structure logic around data transformations and flow, rather than deep class hierarchies or object modeling.
- **Prefer functional programming patterns:**
  - Use immutability, pure functions, and declarative logic when practical.
  - Minimize side effects and tightly coupled state.
- **Code should be modular and predictable:**
  - Functions should do one thing and return consistent results.
  - Separate core logic from I/O, UI, or transport layers.
- **Use the latest stable features of the language:** Modern constructs typically improve clarity and safetyâ€”use them to your advantage.
- **Be expressive, not clever:** Choose readability and maintainability over abstraction or over-optimization.
