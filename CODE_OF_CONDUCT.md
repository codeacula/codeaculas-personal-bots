# Code of Conduct

## ðŸ’› Our Commitment

This project isn't about eliminating our flawsâ€”it's about building something that honors our strengths. We believe tech should reflect real people: imperfect, growing, wildly creative. This is a place where we build scaffolding for each other, not pedestals.

This is a space for creativity, curiosity, and community. Whether you're here to contribute code, share an idea, or just observeâ€”we welcome you with respect and care. We're not here to gatekeep. We're here to grow, together.

We hold space for neurodivergence, queerness, gender expansiveness, disability, trauma, recovery, and the deep messiness of being human. Your safety and dignity matter here.

## ðŸŒˆ We Stand For

- **Respect**: Treat others with care, especially when you disagree.
- **Equity**: Advocate for voices and perspectives historically marginalized in tech.
- **Curiosity**: Ask questions. Explain things without condescension.
- **Accountability**: Own your impact. Repair harm.

## ðŸš« We Donâ€™t Allow

- Harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks
- Dismissing lived experience or identity
- Gatekeeping or shaming others for what they donâ€™t know
- Bigotry of any kind (including racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ableism)

## ðŸ§­ Reporting Harm

If you see something harmful or experience behavior that doesnâ€™t align with these values, please let us know.

- You can message Codeacula privately on Discord
- Or open an issue and mark it confidential

We'll take it seriously and respond with careâ€”not performative punishment.

## âœ¨ Borrowed Backbone

This Code of Conduct is rooted in the [Contributor Covenant v2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) and adapted with intention to reflect the heart of this community.
